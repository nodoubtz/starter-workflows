# Starter Workflows

Welcome to the **Starter Workflows** repository! This project provides a curated collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflow templates designed to help you automate, secure, and optimize your development process quickly and efficiently.

## 🚀 What is This Repo?

This repository contains starter workflow templates that you can use as a foundation for your own CI/CD pipelines. Whether you're building, testing, deploying, or managing your projects, these workflows offer best practices and ready-to-use configurations for various languages and frameworks.

## 📦 Features

- **Easy to Use:** Plug-and-play workflows for popular languages and project types.
- **Secure by Default:** Templates follow security best practices to help protect your code and secrets.
- **Efficient:** Optimized for fast setup and minimal configuration.
- **Customizable:** Easily adapt workflows to fit your unique project requirements.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `.github/workflows/` – Contains all workflow YAML templates.
- `examples/` – Sample projects using these starter workflows.
- `docs/` – Additional documentation and guides.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Browse Workflows:**  
   Go to the `.github/workflows/` directory and review available templates.

2. **Copy a Template:**  
   Copy the desired YAML file into your project’s `.github/workflows/` directory.

3. **Customize:**  
   Adjust the workflow as needed for your project (e.g., environment variables, steps).

4. **Push to GitHub:**  
   Commit and push your changes. GitHub Actions will automatically pick up the new workflow.

## 📝 Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/nodejs.yml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
